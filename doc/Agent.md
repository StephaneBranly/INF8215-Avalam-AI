Interface for an Arlecchino agent
## Attributes
### hasEvolved()
### initialize(percepts,players,time_left)
Begin a new game.
        The computation done here also counts in the time credit.
        Arguments:
        percepts -- the initial board in a form that can be fed to the Board
            constructor.
        players -- sequence of players this agent controls
        time_left -- a float giving the number of seconds left from the time
            credit for this agent (all players taken together). If the game is
            not time-limited, time_left is None.
        
### play(percepts,player,step,time_left)
Play and return an action.
        Arguments:
        percepts -- the current board in a form that can be fed to the Board
            constructor.
        player -- the player to control in this step
        step -- the current step number, starting from 1
        time_left -- a float giving the number of seconds left from the time
            credit. If the game is not time-limited, time_left is None.
